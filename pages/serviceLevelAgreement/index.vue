    <v-card-title>Effective: October 15, 2020</v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>SOWerk provides a 98% <span style="color:blue;"> commitment</span> for customers on a paying subscription plan (our <b>Service Level Agreement</b> or <b>SLA</b>). If we fall short of our 98% Uptime commitment and your SOWerk account is affected, we’ll apply a <span style="color:blue;">Service Credit</span> to your account for future use.</v-card-text>
    <v-card-text>Downtime is the overall number of minutes SOWerk was unavailable during a SOWerk fiscal quarter (i.e., January 1 through March 31 and every three month period thereafter). SOWerk calculates unavailability using server monitoring software to measure the server side error rate, ping test results, web server tests, TCP port tests, and website tests.</v-card-text>
    <br/>
    <v-card-text>Downtime excludes the following:</v-card-text>
    <v-list>
      <v-list-item>• Slowness or other performance issues with individual features </v-list-item>  
      <v-list-item>• Issues that are related to external apps or third parties</v-list-item> 
      <v-list-item>• Any products or features identified as pilot, alpha, beta or similar</v-list-item> 
      <v-list-item>• External network or equipment problems outside of our reasonable control, such as bad routing tables between your internet service provider (ISP) and our server</v-list-item> 
      <v-list-item>• <span style="color:blue;">Scheduled Downtime </span> for maintenance</v-list-item> 
    </v-list>
    <v-card-title>Uptime Commitment</v-card-title>
    <v-card-text><b>Uptime</b> is the percentage of total possible minutes SOWerk was available during a fiscal quarter. Our commitment is to maintain at least 98% Uptime:</v-card-text>
    <v-card-text><b><i>[(total minutes in quarter - Downtime) / total minutes in quarter] > 98%</i></b></v-card-text>
    <v-card-title>Scheduled Downtime</v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>Sometimes we need to perform maintenance to keep SOWerk working smoothly. If scheduled downtime is necessary, we’ll give you at least 24 hours advance notice.</v-card-text>
    <v-card-title>Service Credits</v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>If we fall short of our Uptime commitment, we’ll apply a credit to each affected paying account only equal to 10 times the amount that the SOWerk account paid during the period SOWerk was down (we call these <b>Service Credits</b>).</v-card-text>
    <v-card-text>Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, are capped at a maximum of 30 days of paid service, require you to have paid any outstanding invoices and expire upon termination of your customer contract. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by SOWerk to meet its obligations under this SLA.</v-card-text>
    <v-card-text>Note, Downtime doesn’t affect everyone at the same time or in the same way. For example, some accounts may receive Service Credits during an outage in their region, while other accounts in other regions that have not been similarly affected will not.</v-card-text>  
    <v-card-title>Updates</v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>As our business evolves, we may change our Service Level Agreement. Customers can review the most current version of the Service Level Agreement at any time by visiting this page.</v-card-text>
